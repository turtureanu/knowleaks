## Installing the necessary packages

Because of how `snapper` works, if you're not using `systemd`, you'll need to install `cronie` or a similar cron implementation that provides you with `cron` directories, such as `/etc/cron.hourly` or `/etc/cron.daily`.

Upon installation, `snapper` will use these directories to create its cron jobs, so if you already installed `snapper` but you didn't install `cronie`, you'll need to remove `snapper`, install `cronie`, and finally reinstall `snapper`.

## Configurations

Configuring `snapper` is done through the config files in `/etc/snapper/configs/<profile>`; the default profile is `root`.

Additionally, you may manually edit or move the cron jobs.
