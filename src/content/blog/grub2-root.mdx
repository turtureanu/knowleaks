## The problem

GRUB2, by default, does not protect against configuration changes.

To **_temporarily_** change the default GRUB2 configuration, you:

1. Power on the machine
2. Continouosly tap the ESC key (or maybe [hold down the Shift key](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB/Tips_and_tricks#Hide_GRUB_unless_the_Shift_key_is_held_down))
3. Get to the GRUB2 screen
4. Press "e"

## The exploit(s)

As you can imagine, modifying the boot options used is not ideal. For starters, someone could boot a malicious USB drive (if Secure Boot is enabled) and do all sort of bad stuff.

The easiest method to gain control of the machine, however, is by directly booting into a BASH shell. This is done by hijacking the init process and replacing it with the path to the shell, i.e. `/bin/bash`:

1. Power on the machine
2. Continouosly tap the ESC key
3. Get to the GRUB2 screen

4. Press "e"

5. Find the line starting with "linux"

6. Append `init=/bin/bash`

7. Press Ctrl+x or F10 to boot

## Shutting down

After booting, you might've tried to shut down or reboot the machine, only to see a message similar to the following:

```
System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1).
```

This happens because `init` is supposed to take care of shutting down or rebooting the system. However, we have hijacked it and made it `/bin/bash`, so what if you can't find the power button, or are working remotely?

The fast and easy fix is to press or send the key combination of `Ctrl+Alt+Del`, this will immediately shut down the machine.

## The solution

To fix this, there is, generally speaking, only one reliable solution: setting a password for editing the configuration.

You might also want to disable the recovery boot option by editing `/etc/default/grub` and setting `GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=true`.
