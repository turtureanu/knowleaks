## Warning

This guide is not too specific and might not even work if followed step-by-step. It is only supposed to give you an idea of what to do.

### Edit#0 | July 23 2024

Since I first published this article I have used it several times to intall Artix or other Arch-based distros while only referring to it as a mere handbook of sorts. I advise you do the same.

## Preparing for the install

### Get an Artix bootable image

The download page:

https://artixlinux.org/download.php

The init system (openrc, runit, dinit, or s6) in the filename is the init system the live image uses, not the one you are necessarily going to install.

### Flash the image

You can use any of the following and more:

- [(Balena) Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) (universal)
- [Rufus](https://www.rufus.ltd/) (for Windows users)
- `dd` command (for Linux users)

### Boot and log in as root

Logging in as `root` will save you some time:

```bash
username: root
password: artix
```

### Partition the disks

To partition the disks I'll use `gdisk`, 'cause it's simple, and I like it.

### Formatting the disks

```sh
lsblk # get the identifiers of the partitions (e.g. /dev/sda1)
```

#### EFI System Partition (ESP) — FAT32

```sh
# -n  label
mkfs.vfat -n "ESP" /dev/sda1
```

#### Storage Partition — BtrFS

```sh
# -L  label
mkfs.btrfs -L "Artix" /dev/sda2
```

#### Swap (optional)

```sh
# -L  label
mkswap -L "Swap" /dev/sda3
```

### Configuring BtrFS

BtrFS allows for things like blazing-fast small system snapshots (in case `pacman` breaks your system), self-healing of data, and also filesystem-level compression. It's more simple than OpenZFS, doesn't have any license conflicts, and works well.

  ></iframe>
</div>

That said, it also has some downsides:

- the `nodatacow` and `datacow` mounting options (for using [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write)) [cannot be separately used for each subvolume](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Btrfs#Disabling_CoW)
- some potentially destructive outcomes when using RAID5 or RAID6
- can become really slow if incorrectly configured
- criticized for slowness in general, I haven't personally noticed it nor cared
- less mature than OpenZFS, its stability is sometimes questioned

> If you still want to use nodatacow on a subvolume, see this article for a workaround: https://blog.jim.nz/2015/12/04/btrfs-subvolume-with-nocow.html
> Some people have reported that having VMs which don't use CoW make them faster

#### Create the filesystem

```bash
mkfs.btrfs -L "Artix" /dev/sda
```

> `/dev/sda` is the drive we are writing to, do not confuse this with the flash disk! Use `lsblk` or `blkid` to get the identifier of the drive.

From now on, the disks will be identified as such:

1. `/dev/sda1` -- ESP
2. `/dev/sda2` -- BtrFS
3. `/dev/sda3` -- linux swap

#### Mount the "Artix" BtrFS partition

```sh
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
```

#### Create the subvolumes

> `@` represents root, it is merely a popular BtrFS naming convention, you can completely omit it, but its purpose is to make it clear that the subvolume is actually a subvolume and not something else

Subvolumes allow us to more elegantly control the `mount` options of certain directories, such as compression, `nosuid`, or `noexec`.

```sh
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@ #root
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@home
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@var_cache
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@var_log
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@var_tmp
brtfs sub cr /mnt/@tmp
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@snapshots
```

> `btrfs sub cr` is the same as `btrfs subvolume create`

#### Mount the subvolumes

```sh
umount /mnt
mount -o rw,noatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=60,subvol=@ /dev/sda2 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/{boot,home,var/log,var/cache,var/tmp,tmp,.snapshots}
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
mount -o rw,nodev,noatime,compress=lzo,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=120,subvol=@home /dev/sda2 /mnt/home
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=120,subvol=@var_cache /dev/sda2 /mnt/var/cache
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,compress=zstd:4,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=120,subvol=@var_log /dev/sda2 /mnt/var/log
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=120,subvol=@var_tmp /dev/sda2 /mnt/var/tmp
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,compress=zstd:10,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,subvol=@snapshots /dev/sda2 /mnt/.snapshots
```

LWN article on `atime`, `relatime`, and `noatime` in BtrFS: [Atime and btrfs: a bad combination?](https://lwn.net/Articles/499293/)

## Install Artix

```sh
basestrap /mnt base base-devel openrc elogind-openrc linux-zen linux-zen-headers linux-firmware amd-ucode fish efibootmgr git neovim btrfs-progs
```

### Generate the fstab

```sh
fstabgen -L /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

> Make sure to edit this file and double check everything

### Modify the fstab

Mount /tmp as tmpfs, see https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/tmpfs.html

```sh
echo "tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

### Chroot

```sh
artix-chroot /mnt
```

### Set up locale

#### Timezone

```sh
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```

#### Edit /etc/locale.gen

```sh
nvim /etc/locale.gen
```

#### Generate locale

```sh
locale-gen
```

### Create a user

```sh
passwd # change the root password
useradd -m -s $(which fish) -G wheel tux
passwd tux
```

### Configure the network

Let's install `connman`.

```sh
pacman -S connman-openrc
rc-update add connmand
```

> Connman is good for basic stuff, but I came across a bug, where if you have symbols in your Wi-Fi password it fails to read the password and connect. For more advanced stuff NetworkManager is still the way to go, although I don't like (which is why I use `iwctl` with https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Netifrc)

### Configure BtrFS snapshots

First, we need to install `yay`:

```sh
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
su -l tux
cd /home/tux/yay
makepkg -si
```

Install `cronie` to schedule the snapshots:

```sh
pacman -S cronie
```

> More info: [Configuring snapper without systemd](/blog-posts/snapper-config-openrc/)

Install `snap-pac-git`, which create a snapshot pre- and post-transaction.

```sh
yay snap-pac-git
```

We need to temporarily delete the /.snapshots directory, so we can recreate it using `snapper`:

> We created the /.snapshots directory in order to generate the fstab

```sh
umount /.snapshots
rmdir /.snapshots
snapper -c root create-config / # configure snapper and create /.snapshots
mount -a # remount /.snapshots
```

I should probably change snapper's default configuration, but I don't think I'll ever be bothered, it's not like snapshots occupy a lot of space.

### Install Hyprland (WM)

```sh
yay hyprland-git
```

### Linux EFISTUB

Generate the SB keys by following [Rod Smith's article on controlling secure boot](https://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/controlling-sb.html#creatingkeys).

#### Add custom pacman hooks (outdated)

I created some `pacman` hooks to automate the process of signing and moving the installed kernel.

```sh
cd ## should now be in /root
git clone https://github.com/turtureanu/pacman-hooks.git
cd pacman-hooks
cp *.hook /etc/pacman.d/hooks/
```

##### Edit#1 | July 23 2024

I now dual boot 2 Linux distros using a smart rEFInd & fstab setup, so my current pacman hooks are a bit different, have a look at them:

Hooks:

- 100-remove-linux-before-upgrade.hook
- 940-relocate-kernel.hook
- 940-sign_kernel_for_secure_boot.hook

`100-remove-linux-before-upgrade.hook`:

```sh
[Trigger]
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Type = Package

Target = linux
Target = linux-lts
Target = linux-hardened
Target = linux-zen
Target = linux-xanmod
Target = linux-xanmod-calcule
Target = linux-xanmod-git
Target = linux-xanmod-rt
Target = linux-xanmod-anbox

[Action]
Description = Removing linux kernels before (re)install/upgrade, allows for 940-relocate-linux.hook to work flawlessly (no multiple kernels)
When = PreTransaction
Exec = /bin/sh -c 'rm /boot/vmlinuz* && rm /boot/initramfs*'
```

`940-relocate-kernel.hook`:

```sh
[Trigger]
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Type = Package

Target = linux
Target = linux-lts
Target = linux-hardened
Target = linux-zen
Target = linux-xanmod
Target = linux-xanmod-calcule
Target = linux-xanmod-git
Target = linux-xanmod-rt
Target = linux-xanmod-anbox

[Action]
Description = Rename kernel to know its name for when it gets signed
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /bin/sh -c 'mv /boot/vmlinuz-linux-* /boot/vmlinuz-linux && mv $(ls /boot/initramfs-linux*  | grep -v fallback) /boot/initramfs-linux.img'
```

`940-sign_kernel_for_secure_boot.hook`:

```sh
[Trigger]
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Type = Package

Target = linux
Target = linux-lts
Target = linux-hardened
Target = linux-zen
Target = linux-xanmod
Target = linux-xanmod-calcule
Target = linux-xanmod-git
Target = linux-xanmod-rt
Target = linux-xanmod-anbox

[Action]
Description = Sign the linux kernel for Secure Boot
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /bin/sh -c 'sbsign --key /mnt/boot/EFI_KEYS/DB.key --cert /mnt/boot/EFI_KEYS/DB.crt --output /boot/vmlinuz-linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux'
```

#### mkinitcpio configuration

Edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and modify the following lines:

```sh
MODULES=(btrfs)
.
.
.
COMPRESSION="lz4"
COMPRESSION_OPTIONS=(-9)
```

... and `mkinitcpio -p linux-zen` or whatever your Linux kernel is

#### Create a UEFI entry

```sh
efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 --label "Artix" -l "\EFI\ARTIX\VMLINUZ.EFI" --verbose
```

#### Enroll keys to UEFI

In summary:

1. Disable SB
2. Enroll DB.esl
3. Enroll KEK.esl
4. Enroll PK.auth
5. Enable SB

You may also use a tool such as [`KeyTool.efi`](https://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/controlling-sb.html#keytool), if your UEFI doesn't support manually loading keys from the interface.

After that, we're basically done, I guess.
