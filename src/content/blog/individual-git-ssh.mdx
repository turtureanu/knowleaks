A lot of people have git repositories stored not just on GitHub, but on other platforms such as [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or their own [self-hosted alternative](https://gitea.io/en-us/).

Now, the most convenient way users can authenticate and use these platforms with git is by using SSH keys. Using the same SSH key on all platforms isn't a problem per se, but it is better to use an SSH key for each platform individually.

## Configuring git

```sh
$ git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_ed25519"
```

This will tell git to use the identity file stored in `~/.ssh/github_ed25519`.
To make it the default SSH key, pass the `--global` option:

```sh
$ git config --global core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_ed25519"
```

## Setting the remote

If you cloned the repository over HTTPS, you might want to change the remote to use the SSH address instead.

### Find the remote URLs

```sh
$ git remote -v
  origin  https@github.com:turtureanu/knowleaks.git (fetch)
  origin  https@github.com:turtureanu/knowleaks.git (push)

```

### Replace the remote URLs

```sh
$ git remote remove <remote name>
$ git remote add <remote name> <remote URL>
$ git push --set-upstream <remote name> <branch>
```

or with the example above:

```sh
$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote add origin ssh@github.com:turtureanu/knowleaks.git
$ git push --set-upstream origin main
```
