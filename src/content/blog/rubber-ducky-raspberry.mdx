## What's a rubber ducky?

[The USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky) was another [Hak5](https://hak5.org/) product, its use? A programmable keyboard used for physical attacks. The term "rubber ducky" has since its release been more generalized to include any programmable keyboard that can be used for physical [HID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device) attacks.

The ducky can be easily programmed using the [duckyscript language](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/duckyscript-tm-quick-reference), which is written in ALL-CAPS because duckys like to quack!
