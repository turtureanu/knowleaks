### What is `startup.nsh`

`startup.nsh` is a simple script that should contain only one line, its purpose is to execute UEFI v2 shell code. It is usually located in the EFI system partition (traditionally mounted as `/boot` or `/boot/efi`). The script is useful for a number of reasons, for example: what if you have an EFISTUB kernel and for some reason can't/don't want to use a tool such as `efibootmgr` to create the UEFI entry? Now, this script allows you to more easily pass and modify everything, from kernel parameters to the location of the kernel itself.

### Threat scenario

This scenario assumes that the `/boot` directory has incorrectly been mounted such that a normal user, a normal group, or others can modify its contents. Any intruder—be it malware or an actual attacker with enough privileges—will be able to write to this directory, in doing so, they can create and/or modify the `startup.nsh` file.

They can, for example, pass kernel parameters that can weaken the system and open it up for more attacks (e.g. meltdown and spectre if they chose to set `mitigations=off`). They may even be able to copy their own kernel to the ESP and modify `startup.nsh` so the system boots to it; from a few innocent-looking write permissions they'll have control over the whole system.

### Defense

Fortunately and hopefully, the majority of distro installations mount the ESP with options that prevent any non-sudoer from modifying it, more specifically setting `fmask` and `dmask` to `0077` or `0022`.

Section 3.2 of the [UEFI Shell Spec 2.0](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Shell_Spec_2_0.pdf) describes an option (`--nostartup`) that can be passed to the UEFI shell. I am, however, unsure how someone might actually pass it.
