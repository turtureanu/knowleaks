      <p>
        Hi! ðŸ‘‹ <br />
        <br />
        Name's Sebastian, I'm a hobbyist who self-taught himself front-end web development,
        linux administration, and origami. I like hardening linux servers and thinking
        of new ways of protecting against possible threats. My current field of study
        is cybersecurity, but I am also interested in general IT and programming
        languages.
        <br />
        <br />
        My favorite color's a saturated blue around <span style="color:#00AAFF"
          >#00AAFF</span
        >.
