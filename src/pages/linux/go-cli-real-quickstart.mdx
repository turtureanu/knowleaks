## Setting the GOPATH variable

### Create the directory for your Go projects

Some people prefer having their Go projects in `$HOME/go`, I personally like to have my go projects in `~/projects/go`. It keeps my `$HOME` cleaner.

To change the location of your Go projects, you'll need to set the `GOPATH` enviroment variable:

#### Bash

Add this to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export GOPATH="~/projects/go"
export PATH="$PATH:~/projects/go/bin"
```

#### Fish

Add this to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
  set -gx GOPATH /home/<username>/projects/go
  fish_add_path /home/<username>/projects/go/bin
```

> the `go/bin` directory is used to access `cobra-cli`

## Create a git repository for the CLI application

In this example, I'll be using GitHub to host my code, to use any other platform replace `github.com` with the domain of the hosting platform (e.g. `codeberg.org`).

### Clone the repo

```sh
  git clone git@github.com:username/name-of-cli.git
```

then `cd name-of-cli`

## Initalize the module of your app

```sh
  go mod init github.com/username/name-of-cli
```

## Configuring Cobra

[Cobra](https://cobra.dev/) provides a [`cobra-cli`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/blob/main/README.md) tool for generating all the necessary files you'll need.

### Install Cobra

```sh
  go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

> Because Cobra is a dependency of `cobra-cli`, you'll only need to install the `cobra-cli` tool.

### Initalize the Cobra application

```sh
  cobra-cli init
```

That's it.
