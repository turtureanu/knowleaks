## Download the Devuan Raspberry Pi Image

The Devuan community regularly builds [headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer) images for the ARM architectures, they also provide images for all Raspberry Pi models.
You can download them at: [https://arm-files.devuan.org/RaspberryPi Latest Builds/](https://arm-files.devuan.org/RaspberryPi%20Latest%20Builds/)

As far as I know, these come with the [runit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runit) init system.

## Flash the image

I recommend using the official [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) ([source code](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-imager)), but you are free to use whatever you like.

### 1. Open the Raspberry Pi Imager

### 2. Select the Devuan Image

### 3. Select the micro SD card

### 4. Flash the drive

After the flashing has finished, just pop back the micro SD card into your Raspberry Pi, and it should boot normally.

> To enable SSH you need to [create an empty file named ssh](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#enabling-the-server) in the boot partition.

## Post Install

You can log into the system as `root` or as the `devuan` sudoer using `toor` and `devuan` as passwords, respectively, although you can only SSH as `devuan`.

After logging in, you should get a screen similar to this:

```sh
$ ssh devuan@devuanpi
devuan@devuanpi's password:

```

You should also run the following command:

```sh
devuan@devuanpi:~$ menu-config
```

It presents you with a menu, from which you can quickly configure things such as the timezone, network, or the kernel governor.

## Edit#0 | Feb 4 2023

Some time after flashing the `rpi-2+3-devuan-chimaera-5.10.110-armhf-ext4-2023-02-02.zip` image I have experienced kernel panics, random system freezes, `dpkg` compression errors, network errors, and weird text console behavior over SSH, these might've been caused by:

- setting the incorrect timezone
- using kitty-term as $TERM
- frequently upgrading packages
- having the network cable physically detach itself at random
- pulling the power cable out a couple of times

After having experienced these errors I deemed the system as unusable and tried installing Devuan Daedalus (testing) as opposed to Chimaera using the following image: `rpi-2+3-devuan-daedalus-5.18.19-armhf-ext4-2023-01-15.zip`

All the problems are gone as of now, and the only warning I got was after an `apt upgrade`:

```sh
(Reading database ... 70014 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack .../dpkg_1.21.19_armhf.deb ...
Unpacking dpkg (1.21.19) over (1.21.17) ...
Setting up dpkg (1.21.19) ...
dpkg: warning: This system uses merged-usr-via-aliased-dirs, going behind dpkg's
dpkg: warning: back, breaking its core assumptions. This can cause silent file
dpkg: warning: overwrites and disappearances, and its general tools misbehavior.
dpkg: warning: See <https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ#broken-usrmerge>.
```

Let's hope it's harmless in the long run.

## Edit#1 | Feb 4 2023

The `dpkg` problems have returned, it seems like multiple `armhf` packages have been corrupted in such a way that `dpkg` can't unpack them (`dpkg-deb` curiously works though). I tried switching to a mirror (http://sledjhamr.org/devuan/merged) and changing the suite to Chimaera (because Daedalus had the same corrupted packages). This seemed to work fine for the time being, but ended up failing because `/var/lib/dpkg/status` had a couple of random characters inserted throughout it (how does that even happen?!). Anyway, halfway through the bug report, I tried fixing up the status file and removing [`nala`](https://gitlab.com/volian/nala) (a pretty `apt` wrapper), after that and switching back to the "faulty" package repository, I once again tried installing and upgrading stuff and it surprisingly worked, couple minutes passed and the problems made themselves known again, I don't know what happened or why some archives are still getting corrupted.

In the meantime I've switched to Alpine Linux, where the packages are handled by the [`apk`](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Package_Keeper) package manager. I installed Alpine in [sys mode](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Installation#System_Disk_Mode) (default is [diskless](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Installation#Diskless_Mode)) with the help of the [Alpine Linux wiki article](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Classic_install_or_sys_mode_on_Raspberry_Pi) on how to do just that.

Everything seems to be running just fine, let's just hope it stays that way.
