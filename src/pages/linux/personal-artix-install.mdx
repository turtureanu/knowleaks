## Warning

This guide is not too specific and might not even work if followed step-by-step. \
It is only supposed to give you an idea of what to do.

## Preparing for the install

### Get an Artix bootable image

The download page:

https://artixlinux.org/download.php

The init system (openrc, runit, dinit, or s6) in the filename is the init system the live image uses, not the image you are necessarily going to install.

The Artix live image can bootstrap any package from the Artix package repositories.

### Flash the image

You can use any of the following and more:

- [(Balena) Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) (universaL)
- [Rufus](https://www.rufus.ltd/) (for Windows users)
- `dd` command (for Linux users)

### Boot and log in as root

Logging in as `root`'ll save you some time:

```bash
username: root
password: artix
```

### Partition the disks

To partition the disks I'll use `gdisk`, 'cause it's simple, and I like it.

### Formatting the disks

```sh
lsblk # get the identifiers of the partitions (e.g. /dev/sda1)
```

#### EFI System Partition (ESP) — FAT32

```sh
mkfs.vfat -n "ESP" /dev/sda1
```

#### Storage Partition — BtrFS

```sh
mkfs.btrfs -L "Artix" /dev/sda2
```

#### Swap (optional)

```sh
mkswap -L "Swap" /dev/sda3
```

### Configuring BtrFS

BtrFS allows for things like blazing-fast small system snapshots (in case `pacman` breaks your system), self-healing of data, and also filesystem-level compression. It's more simple than OpenZFS, doesn't have any license conflicts, and works well.

That said, it also has some downsides:

- the `nodatacow` and `datacow` mounting options (for using [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write)) [cannot be separately used for each subvolume](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Btrfs#Disabling_CoW)
- some potentially destructive outcomes when using RAID5 or RAID6
- can become really slow if incorrectly configured
- criticized for slowness in general, I haven't personally noticed it nor cared
- less mature than OpenZFS, its stability is sometimes questioned

#### Create the filesystem

```bash
mkfs.btrfs -L "Artix" /dev/sda
```

> `/dev/sda` is the drive we are writing to, do not confuse this with the flash disk! Use `lsblk` or `blkid` to get the identifier of the drive.

From now on, the disks will be identified as such:

1. `/dev/sda1` -- ESP
2. `/dev/sda2` -- BtrFS
3. `/dev/sda3` -- linux swap

#### Mount the "Artix" BtrFS partition

```sh
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
```

#### Create the subvolumes

> `@` represents root, it is merely a popular BtrFS naming convention, you can completely omit it, but its purpose is to make it clear that the subvolume is actually a subvolume and not something else

Subvolumes allow us to more elegantly control the `mount` options of certain directories, such as compression, `nosuid`, or `noexec`.

```sh
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@ #root
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@home
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@var_cache
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@var_log
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@var_tmp
brtfs sub cr /mnt/@tmp
btrfs sub cr /mnt/@snapshots
```

> `btrfs sub cr` is the same as `btrfs subvolume create`

#### Mount the subvolumes

```sh
umount /mnt
mount -o rw,noatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=60,subvol=@ /dev/sda2 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/{boot,home,var/log,var/cache,var/tmp,tmp,.snapshots}
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
mount -o rw,nodev,noatime,compress=lzo,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=120,subvol=@home /mnt/home
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=120,subvol=@var_cache /dev/sda2 /mnt/var/cache
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,compress=zstd:4,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=120,subvol=@var_log /dev/sda2 /mnt/var/log
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,commit=120,subvol=@var_tmp /dev/sda2 /mnt/var/tmp
mount -o rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,compress=zstd:10,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,subvol=@snapshots /dev/sda2 /mnt/.snapshots
```

## Install Artix

```sh
basestrap /mnt base base-devel openrc elogind-openrc linux-zen linux-zen-headers linux-firmware amd-ucode fish efibootmgr git neovim btrfs-progs
```

### Generate the fstab

```sh
fstabgen -L /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

> Make sure to edit this file and double check everything

### Chroot

```sh
artix-chroot /mnt
```

### Set up locale

#### Timezone

```sh
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```

#### Edit /etc/locale.gen

```sh
nvim /etc/locale.gen
```

#### Generate locale

```sh
locale-gen
```

### Create a user

```sh
passwd # change the root password
useradd -m -s $(which fish) -G wheel tux
passwd tux
```

### Configure the network

Let's install `connman`

```sh
pacman -S connman-openrc
rc-update add connmand
```

### Configure BtrFS snapshots

First, we need to install `yay`:

```sh
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

Install `snap-pac-git`, which create a snapshot pre- and post-transaction.

```sh
yay snap-pac-git
```

We need to temporarily delete the /.snapshots directory, so we can recreate it using `snapper`:

```sh
umount /.snapshots
rmdir /.snapshots
snapper -c root create-config / # configure snapper and create /.snapshots
mount -a # remount /.snapshots
```

I should probably change snapper's default configuration, but I don't think I'll ever be bothered, it's not like snapshots occupy a lot of space.

### Install Hyprland

```sh
yay hyprland-git
```

### Linux EFISTUB

Generate the SB keys by following [Rod Smith's article on controlling secure boot](https://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/controlling-sb.html#creatingkeys).

For more information on SB:
https://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/index.html

#### Add custom pacman hooks

I created some `pacman` hooks to automate the process of signing and moving the installed kernel.

```sh
cd ## should now be in /root
git clone https://github.com/turtureanu/pacman-hooks.git
cd pacman-hooks
cp *.hook /etc/pacman.d/hooks/
```

#### mkinitcpio configuration

Edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and modify the following lines:

```sh
MODULES=(btrfs)
.
.
.
COMPRESSION="lz4"
COMPRESSION_OPTIONS=(-9)
```

... and `mkinitcpio -p linux-zen` or whatever your Linux kernel is

#### Create a UEFI entry

```sh
efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 --label "Artix" -l "\EFI\ARTIX\VMLINUZ.EFI" --verbose
```

#### Enroll keys to UEFI

In summary:

1. Disable SB
2. Enroll DB.esl
3. Enroll KEK.esl
4. Enroll PK.auth
5. Enable SB

You may also use a tool such as `KeyTool.efi`, if your UEFI doesn't support manually loading keys from the interface.

After that, we're basically done, I guess.
