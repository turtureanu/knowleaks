A lot of people have git repositories stored not just on GitHub, but on other platform such as [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or their own [self-hosted alternative](https://gitea.io/en-us/).

Now, the most convenient way users can authenticate and use these platforms with git is by using SSH keys. Using the same SSH key on all platforms isn't a problem per se, but it is better to use an SSH key for each platform individually.

## Configuring git

```sh
git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_ed25519"
```

This will tell git to use the identity file stored in `~/.ssh/github_ed25519`.
To make it the default SSH key, pass the `--global` option:

```sh
git config --global core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_ed25519"
```
